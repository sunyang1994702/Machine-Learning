# Machine-Learning
Machine learning was a type of computer science which can automatically give a decisive result with empirical training by use of the data. It is divided by supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 
The flow of machine learning: Data exploration -> Data cleaning -> Data engineering -> Model training -> Prediction -> Model evaluation.

## Data exploration
Visualizaing and understanding the data firstly. 
Several things need to do: Take a first image on distribution of data if it matches normal distribution or randomization. The condition about abnormal value, null value, mean value, standard deviation and unique feature. Also the relations between target variable and features.
