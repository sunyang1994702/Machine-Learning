# Machine-Learning
Machine learning was a type of computer science which can automatically give a decisive result with empirical training by use of the data. It is divided by supervised learning and unsupervised learning.  
The flow of machine learning: Data exploration -> Data cleaning -> Feature engineering -> Model training -> Prediction -> Model evaluation.

## Data exploration
Visualizaing and understanding the data firstly.  
Several things need to do: Take a first image on distribution of data if it matches normal distribution or randomization. The condition about abnormal value, null value, mean value, standard deviation and unique feature. Also the relations between target variable and features.

## Data cleaning
Step is so important for prediction accuracy. Deleting and correcting error value, incomplete, incorrectly formatted or redundant data. Filling the null value by mean value. 

## Feature engineering
The step is extracting and transforming the most relevant features from raw data.  
Sometimes, the number of feature in one dataset was very huge, need to do dimensionality reduction. Methods: PCA (principal component analysis) and LDA (linear discriminant analysis).  
Sometimes, the standard of each feature was different, need to do nondimensionalization in order to transform different standard features to the same standard. Methods: standardization, min-max rescaling and normalization.
